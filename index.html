        <p id="about-info">I graduated in December of 2022 with a bachelors degree in forensic biology from <strong>Eastern Kentucky University.</strong> In my junior year of college, I decided that I wanted to pursue something in the computer science field instead, as I had always been interested in learning how to program. In May of 2023, I began a web development bootcamp through <strong>We Can Code It</strong>, and am expected to finish the program in October of 2023.</p>
